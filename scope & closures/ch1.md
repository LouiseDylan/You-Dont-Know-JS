# 关于JS你不知道的：作用域和闭包
# 第一章：什么是作用域？

基本所有程序语言一个最基本的特征是，把数据储存在变量里，并可以调用且修改数据的能力。事实上，储存和调用数据的能力，给了程序*域*的概念。

如果没有这个概念， 程序虽然可以跑一些任务， 但功能十分受限并且无趣。

这个概念带给程序一个十分有趣的问题：变量究竟 *生活* 在哪里? 换句话说， 变量存在哪里？更重要的是，当我们想用它们的时候，我们是怎么获取它们的。

这个问题引出的问题是， 如何合理的定义一系列规则去在特定区域储存变量， 并且稍后如何获取它们， 我们把这一系列规则称之为 *作用域* （*Scope*）。


## 编译原理
* 译者：以下段落待优化，以下保留英文段落均为待商榷段落。*
Javascript虽然号称动态的解析的程序语言，但实际上也是一种需要编译的语言。对比传统语言，它 的编译并不算非常完美，nor are the results of compilation portable among various distributed systems.
It may be self-evident, or it may be surprising, depending on your level of interaction with various languages, but despite the fact that JavaScript falls under the general category of "dynamic" or "interpreted" languages, it is in fact a compiled language. It is *not* compiled well in advance, as are many traditionally-compiled languages, nor are the results of compilation portable among various distributed systems.

但是，作为js引擎，它依然要做和传统语言编译器一样的工作，一些非常复杂的步骤，有时候远比我们想象的复杂。

传统语言中，在它真正被执行之前, 代码通常要经过三个步骤（我们称之为编译）：

1.**标记+词法分析 Tokenizing/Lexing:**: 把程序语言切成一段一段的片段，称之为tokens。比如，程序中的 `var a = 2;`,会被切成如下tokens：`var`, `a`, `=`, `2`, `;`。 空格有可能被切成token也有可能不被，取决于它在程序中是否有意义。
	**注:** 标记和词法分析的区别很小并且学术化， 他们关注的点在于划词的时候是否判断它所处的位置，比如，标记相当于把`a` 划出来，而词法分析(Lexing)则需要判断这段代码究竟是自己包含全部含义还是属于其他代码片段的。

2. **解析 Parsing:** 把token流转换成树，是嵌套元素形式，符合语法结构和规则，这个树被称之为"AST" (<b>A</b>bstract <b>S</b>yntax <b>T</b>ree).

    `var a = 2;`的树，开始于顶层节点 `VariableDeclaration`, 包含子节点  `Identifier` (值 `a`), 另外一个子节点 `AssignmentExpression` 包含另外子节点  `NumericLiteral` (值 `2`).
    

3. **代码生成 Code-Generation:** 这个过程是把AST转换成可执行代码， 这部分各程序语言和个平台之间会有极大的不同。
所以，刨除细节，`var a = 2;`会被转换成机器语言，在内存中*创建*一个变量 `a`,而后把值储存其中。

    **注:** 代码引擎如何管理系统资源包含更多深入细节，我们只当作引擎能够创建和存储变量即可。

和其他语言一样，Javascript引擎还要做很多很多事情，比如在解析和代码生成的过程中，有些步骤用来优化执行性能，比如压缩冗余元素等。
我们目前只是粗线条的看一下，但是细节对于更高层次还是有必要的。
有一点要注意的是，JS引擎不是很奢侈，它并没有用大量时间去调校，因为js编译没有预构建（doesn't happen in a build step ahead of time）。
javascript的编译，执行就是发生，代码和执行之间只有几微秒甚至还不到，为了保证最快的表现，JS引擎使用了各种技巧，比如JITS（缓压缩，甚至热重压缩），这些已经超过今天要谈的“域”的概念。

简言之，JS在执行之前需要被解析，而这个解析过程很快。

## 理解域
理解域这个概念之前，我们先要了解一个概念叫做对话(conversation)。

### 演员

我们来看下 `var a = 2;`里的演员, 以便稍后理解他们之间的对话：

1. *引擎Engine*: 影响JavaScript程序执行全程。

2. *编译器Compiler*: *Engine*的好朋友; 处理所有棘手的难题，以及代码生成。

3. *作用域Scope*: *Engine*另外一个朋友; 收集和保持所有变量声明的查找表，强制和通过严格规则来组织代码。

想要完全理解JavaScript的运作，你需要想引擎所想，问引擎所问，回答他们的问题。

### 向后 & 向前

When you see the program `var a = 2;`, you most likely think of that as one statement. But that's not how our new friend *Engine* sees it. In fact, *Engine* sees two distinct statements, one which *Compiler* will handle during compilation, and one which *Engine* will handle during execution.

So, let's break down how *Engine* and friends will approach the program `var a = 2;`.

The first thing *Compiler* will do with this program is perform lexing to break it down into tokens, which it will then parse into a tree. But when *Compiler* gets to code-generation, it will treat this program somewhat differently than perhaps assumed.

A reasonable assumption would be that *Compiler* will produce code that could be summed up by this pseudo-code: "Allocate memory for a variable, label it `a`, then stick the value `2` into that variable." Unfortunately, that's not quite accurate.

*Compiler* will instead proceed as:

1. Encountering `var a`, *Compiler* asks *Scope* to see if a variable `a` already exists for that particular scope collection. If so, *Compiler* ignores this declaration and moves on. Otherwise, *Compiler* asks *Scope* to declare a new variable called `a` for that scope collection.

2. *Compiler* then produces code for *Engine* to later execute, to handle the `a = 2` assignment. The code *Engine* runs will first ask *Scope* if there is a variable called `a` accessible in the current scope collection. If so, *Engine* uses that variable. If not, *Engine* looks *elsewhere* (see nested *Scope* section below).

If *Engine* eventually finds a variable, it assigns the value `2` to it. If not, *Engine* will raise its hand and yell out an error!

To summarize: two distinct actions are taken for a variable assignment: First, *Compiler* declares a variable (if not previously declared in the current scope), and second, when executing, *Engine* looks up the variable in *Scope* and assigns to it, if found.

### Compiler Speak

We need a little bit more compiler terminology to proceed further with understanding.

When *Engine* executes the code that *Compiler* produced for step (2), it has to look-up the variable `a` to see if it has been declared, and this look-up is consulting *Scope*. But the type of look-up *Engine* performs affects the outcome of the look-up.

In our case, it is said that *Engine* would be performing an "LHS" look-up for the variable `a`. The other type of look-up is called "RHS".

I bet you can guess what the "L" and "R" mean. These terms stand for "Left-hand Side" and "Right-hand Side".

Side... of what? **Of an assignment operation.**

In other words, an LHS look-up is done when a variable appears on the left-hand side of an assignment operation, and an RHS look-up is done when a variable appears on the right-hand side of an assignment operation.

Actually, let's be a little more precise. An RHS look-up is indistinguishable, for our purposes, from simply a look-up of the value of some variable, whereas the LHS look-up is trying to find the variable container itself, so that it can assign. In this way, RHS doesn't *really* mean "right-hand side of an assignment" per se, it just, more accurately, means "not left-hand side".

Being slightly glib for a moment, you could also think "RHS" instead means "retrieve his/her source (value)", implying that RHS means "go get the value of...".

Let's dig into that deeper.

When I say:

```js
console.log( a );
```

The reference to `a` is an RHS reference, because nothing is being assigned to `a` here. Instead, we're looking-up to retrieve the value of `a`, so that the value can be passed to `console.log(..)`.

By contrast:

```js
a = 2;
```

The reference to `a` here is an LHS reference, because we don't actually care what the current value is, we simply want to find the variable as a target for the `= 2` assignment operation.

**Note:** LHS and RHS meaning "left/right-hand side of an assignment" doesn't necessarily literally mean "left/right side of the `=` assignment operator". There are several other ways that assignments happen, and so it's better to conceptually think about it as: "who's the target of the assignment (LHS)" and "who's the source of the assignment (RHS)".

Consider this program, which has both LHS and RHS references:

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a ); // 2
}

foo( 2 );
```

The last line that invokes `foo(..)` as a function call requires an RHS reference to `foo`, meaning, "go look-up the value of `foo`, and give it to me." Moreover, `(..)` means the value of `foo` should be executed, so it'd better actually be a function!

There's a subtle but important assignment here. **Did you spot it?**

You may have missed the implied `a = 2` in this code snippet. It happens when the value `2` is passed as an argument to the `foo(..)` function, in which case the `2` value is **assigned** to the parameter `a`. To (implicitly) assign to parameter `a`, an LHS look-up is performed.

There's also an RHS reference for the value of `a`, and that resulting value is passed to `console.log(..)`. `console.log(..)` needs a reference to execute. It's an RHS look-up for the `console` object, then a property-resolution occurs to see if it has a method called `log`.

Finally, we can conceptualize that there's an LHS/RHS exchange of passing the value `2` (by way of variable `a`'s RHS look-up) into `log(..)`. Inside of the native implementation of `log(..)`, we can assume it has parameters, the first of which (perhaps called `arg1`) has an LHS reference look-up, before assigning `2` to it.

**Note:** You might be tempted to conceptualize the function declaration `function foo(a) {...` as a normal variable declaration and assignment, such as `var foo` and `foo = function(a){...`. In so doing, it would be tempting to think of this function declaration as involving an LHS look-up.

However, the subtle but important difference is that *Compiler* handles both the declaration and the value definition during code-generation, such that when *Engine* is executing code, there's no processing necessary to "assign" a function value to `foo`. Thus, it's not really appropriate to think of a function declaration as an LHS look-up assignment in the way we're discussing them here.

### Engine/Scope Conversation

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a ); // 2
}

foo( 2 );
```

Let's imagine the above exchange (which processes this code snippet) as a conversation. The conversation would go a little something like this:

> ***Engine***: Hey *Scope*, I have an RHS reference for `foo`. Ever heard of it?

> ***Scope***: Why yes, I have. *Compiler* declared it just a second ago. He's a function. Here you go.

> ***Engine***: Great, thanks! OK, I'm executing `foo`.

> ***Engine***: Hey, *Scope*, I've got an LHS reference for `a`, ever heard of it?

> ***Scope***: Why yes, I have. *Compiler* declared it as a formal parameter to `foo` just recently. Here you go.

> ***Engine***: Helpful as always, *Scope*. Thanks again. Now, time to assign `2` to `a`.

> ***Engine***: Hey, *Scope*, sorry to bother you again. I need an RHS look-up for `console`. Ever heard of it?

> ***Scope***: No problem, *Engine*, this is what I do all day. Yes, I've got `console`. He's built-in. Here ya go.

> ***Engine***: Perfect. Looking up `log(..)`. OK, great, it's a function.

> ***Engine***: Yo, *Scope*. Can you help me out with an RHS reference to `a`. I think I remember it, but just want to double-check.

> ***Scope***: You're right, *Engine*. Same guy, hasn't changed. Here ya go.

> ***Engine***: Cool. Passing the value of `a`, which is `2`, into `log(..)`.

> ...

### Quiz

Check your understanding so far. Make sure to play the part of *Engine* and have a "conversation" with the *Scope*:

```js
function foo(a) {
	var b = a;
	return a + b;
}

var c = foo( 2 );
```

1. Identify all the LHS look-ups (there are 3!).

2. Identify all the RHS look-ups (there are 4!).

**Note:** See the chapter review for the quiz answers!

## Nested Scope

We said that *Scope* is a set of rules for looking up variables by their identifier name. There's usually more than one *Scope* to consider, however.

Just as a block or function is nested inside another block or function, scopes are nested inside other scopes. So, if a variable cannot be found in the immediate scope, *Engine* consults the next outer containing scope, continuing until found or until the outermost (aka, global) scope has been reached.

Consider:

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a + b );
}

var b = 2;

foo( 2 ); // 4
```

The RHS reference for `b` cannot be resolved inside the function `foo`, but it can be resolved in the *Scope* surrounding it (in this case, the global).

So, revisiting the conversations between *Engine* and *Scope*, we'd overhear:

> ***Engine***: "Hey, *Scope* of `foo`, ever heard of `b`? Got an RHS reference for it."

> ***Scope***: "Nope, never heard of it. Go fish."

> ***Engine***: "Hey, *Scope* outside of `foo`, oh you're the global *Scope*, ok cool. Ever heard of `b`? Got an RHS reference for it."

> ***Scope***: "Yep, sure have. Here ya go."

The simple rules for traversing nested *Scope*: *Engine* starts at the currently executing *Scope*, looks for the variable there, then if not found, keeps going up one level, and so on. If the outermost global scope is reached, the search stops, whether it finds the variable or not.

### Building on Metaphors

To visualize the process of nested *Scope* resolution, I want you to think of this tall building.

<img src="fig1.png" width="250">

The building represents our program's nested *Scope* rule set. The first floor of the building represents your currently executing *Scope*, wherever you are. The top level of the building is the global *Scope*.

You resolve LHS and RHS references by looking on your current floor, and if you don't find it, taking the elevator to the next floor, looking there, then the next, and so on. Once you get to the top floor (the global *Scope*), you either find what you're looking for, or you don't. But you have to stop regardless.

## Errors

Why does it matter whether we call it LHS or RHS?

Because these two types of look-ups behave differently in the circumstance where the variable has not yet been declared (is not found in any consulted *Scope*).

Consider:

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a + b );
	b = a;
}

foo( 2 );
```

When the RHS look-up occurs for `b` the first time, it will not be found. This is said to be an "undeclared" variable, because it is not found in the scope.

If an RHS look-up fails to ever find a variable, anywhere in the nested *Scope*s, this results in a `ReferenceError` being thrown by the *Engine*. It's important to note that the error is of the type `ReferenceError`.

By contrast, if the *Engine* is performing an LHS look-up, and it arrives at the top floor (global *Scope*) without finding it, if the program is not running in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode], then the global *Scope* will create a new variable of that name **in the global scope**, and hand it back to *Engine*.

*"No, there wasn't one before, but I was helpful and created one for you."*

"Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode], which was added in ES5, has a number of different behaviors from normal/relaxed/lazy mode. One such behavior is that it disallows the automatic/implicit global variable creation. In that case, there would be no global *Scope*'d variable to hand back from an LHS look-up, and *Engine* would throw a `ReferenceError` similarly to the RHS case.

Now, if a variable is found for an RHS look-up, but you try to do something with its value that is impossible, such as trying to execute-as-function a non-function value, or reference a property on a `null` or `undefined` value, then *Engine* throws a different kind of error, called a `TypeError`.

`ReferenceError` is *Scope* resolution-failure related, whereas `TypeError` implies that *Scope* resolution was successful, but that there was an illegal/impossible action attempted against the result.

## Review (TL;DR)

Scope is the set of rules that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked-up. This look-up may be for the purposes of assigning to the variable, which is an LHS (left-hand-side) reference, or it may be for the purposes of retrieving its value, which is an RHS (right-hand-side) reference.

LHS references result from assignment operations. *Scope*-related assignments can occur either with the `=` operator or by passing arguments to (assign to) function parameters.

The JavaScript *Engine* first compiles code before it executes, and in so doing, it splits up statements like `var a = 2;` into two separate steps:

1. First, `var a` to declare it in that *Scope*. This is performed at the beginning, before code execution.

2. Later, `a = 2` to look up the variable (LHS reference) and assign to it if found.

Both LHS and RHS reference look-ups start at the currently executing *Scope*, and if need be (that is, they don't find what they're looking for there), they work their way up the nested *Scope*, one scope (floor) at a time, looking for the identifier, until they get to the global (top floor) and stop, and either find it, or don't.

Unfulfilled RHS references result in `ReferenceError`s being thrown. Unfulfilled LHS references result in an automatic, implicitly-created global of that name (if not in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]), or a `ReferenceError` (if in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]).
